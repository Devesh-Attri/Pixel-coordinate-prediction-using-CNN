# Pixel-coordinate-prediction-using-CNN
A deep learning–based approach to localize a single high-intensity pixel in a 50×50 grayscale image. The project uses a fully convolutional neural network to predict pixel coordinates via heatmap regression, with complete dataset generation, training, evaluation and visualization pipelines.
